Needle in a haystack? Yes please... This is what Heejung said when she joined the lab as a freshman ~4 years ago. The manuscript describing her work is published with support from the team including but not limited to the unflappable Kerim Heber and Susan Tian. Read it at [mBio](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02341-25).
