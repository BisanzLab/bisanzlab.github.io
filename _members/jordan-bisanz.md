Dr. Jordan Bisanz is an assistant professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Dorothy Foehr and J. Lloyd Huck Early Career Chair in Host-Microbiome Interactions at the Pennsylvania State University and the One Health Microbiome Center. The Bisanz lab combines multi-omics analyses, gnotobiotic animal models, and wet lab experimentation to understand how gut microbes interact with each other and their host to shape health. With a dual focus on generating both mechanistic knowledge, and leveraging it for translational applications, the Bisanz lab is active in the development of microbiota-targeted interventions including genetically engineered probiotics and synthetic fecal microbiota transplants.
