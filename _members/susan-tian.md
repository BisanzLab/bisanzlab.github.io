She received a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biotechnology and Molecular Biology from Rochester Institute of Technology and worked as a research technician at Litron Laboratories designing high-throughput genetic toxicology testing, assaying genotoxins, and watering the plants. She has won speaker awards im the Huck Life Science Symposium and the Best Presentation for early-career researchers in the Changing Microbiomes Symposium. Outside the lab, she extends her skillsets by constantly learning new activities such as fishing, golfing, dancing, shooting, drawing, kickboxing, and etc. Fun fact, she is a pro-nail artist!
